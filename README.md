# Zettel POV API

## Overview

The Zettel POV API is a tool designed to enhance the study of literature by combining the Zettelkasten note-taking method with detailed Point of View (POV) analysis. This application allows users to create, connect, and analyze notes about literary works, focusing on narrative techniques and POV elements.

### For Literature Students

This API (Application Programming Interface) serves as a digital tool to help you analyze and connect ideas from your literary studies. Here's how it can enhance your work:

1. **Atomic Note-Taking**: Create small, focused notes about specific aspects of literary works.
2. **POV Analysis**: Analyze narrative techniques, including narrator trustworthiness, epistemic anomalies, and narration nodes.
3. **Interconnected Ideas**: Use tags to create organic connections between related concepts across different works or authors.
4. **Discover Patterns**: Explore relationships between ideas through tag clouds and related notes features.

By using this tool, you'll be able to build a network of literary analysis that can reveal new insights and connections in your studies.

### For Developers

This project is built using Astro.js and Supabase, implementing a Zettelkasten-inspired note-taking system with a focus on POV analysis in literature.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Astro.js
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database)
- **API**: RESTful endpoints served by Astro.js
- **Deployment**: [Specify your deployment platform, e.g., Vercel, Netlify]

## Key Features

1. CRUD operations for notes
2. Tagging system for organic note connections
3. POV analysis fields (narrator trustworthiness, epistemic anomalies, narration nodes)
4. Search functionality
5. Related notes based on shared tags
6. Tag cloud for exploring note connections
